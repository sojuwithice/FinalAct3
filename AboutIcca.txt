Hi! I'm Irricca G. Balin, a second-year BS Information Technology student. Alongside mys studies, I find joy in cooking new recipes, working on creative DIY projects, and ensuring I get enough rest to recharge.

Why BSIT? I want to expand my knowledge about computers and explore new things.

I'm someone who loves K-pop, fascinated by its catchy tunes, dynamic choreography, and global cultural influence.
